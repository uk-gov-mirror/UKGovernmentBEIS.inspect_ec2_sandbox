# Inspect EC2 Sandbox

## Purpose

This plugin for [Inspect](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) allows you to use virtual machines
as sandboxes, running within AWS EC2.

## Installing

Add this using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

```
uv add inspect-ec2-sandbox
```
or with pip,

```
pip install inspect-ec2-sandbox
```


## AWS Infrastructure

This plugin depends on certain infrastructure existing already. See the [infra docs](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ec2_sandbox/blob/main/infra/README.md) for a
reference CDK stack which you can use to create it. If you use the reference stack, you can skip reading
the rest of this section.

This plugin creates EC2 instances as necessary using the AWS API, so you do not need to create them yourself.

### VPC

You must have a VPC in which the EC2 instances will be created.

You can specify the subnet and security group.

Within the subnet and security group, instances *must* be able to connect to:

- SSM
- SSM Messages
- S3
- EC2 Messages

Incoming SSH access is not necessary (and is discouraged for security reasons.)

### S3

An S3 bucket is required for file transfer, and to record the results of SSM command invocations.

If desired, you can specify a key prefix such that all objects will be created below the prefix.

The plugin should clean up after itself; the bucket is not used for long-term storage.

### IAM

EC2 instances created by the plugin require an Instance Profile that allows:

- read/write access to the S3 bucket
- SSM access (the managed policy AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore is adequate)

It's recommended not to exceed the above scope, since Inspect AI agents using the
sandbox will be able to invoke whatever AWS services are permitted.

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

The provider will use the latest Ubuntu 24.04 AMI by default.

Otherwise you can specify an AMI with the config parameter `ami_id` 
or the environment variable `INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_AMI_ID`. 

Your AMI must have the 
[AWS SSM agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ami-preinstalled-agent.html).

## Configuring evals

You can configure the eval using either environment variables, or by configuration in Python code, or both.
Configuration takes precedence over environment variables.

To make an eval portable it's recommended to set `ami_id` and `instance_type` in code,
and allow the end-user to specify the rest.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables must be set:

```bash
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_VPC_ID=vpc-123456
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_SECURITY_GROUP_ID=sg-56781234
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_SUBNET_ID=subnet-654321
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_INSTANCE_PROFILE=Ec2SandboxStack-SandboxInstanceProfile123-456
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_S3_BUCKET=ec2sandboxstack-databucket123-456
```

The following environment variables are optional:

```bash
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_REGION=eu-west-1
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_AMI_ID=ami-123456
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_INSTANCE_TYPE=t3a.small
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_S3_KEY_PREFIX=sandbox-comms
INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_EXTRA_TAGS_STR='tagname1=tagvalue1;tagname2=tagvalue2'
```

`INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_REGION` is only needed to override the region. When it is
unset the region comes from [boto3's standard configuration chain][boto3-config],
which raises an error if nothing is configured.

> **Note:** boto3 resolves the region from `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, **not**
> `AWS_REGION`. This differs from the AWS CLI and the JavaScript/Go/Java SDKs,
> which read `AWS_REGION`. Export `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (or set
> `INSPECT_EC2_SANDBOX_REGION`).

[boto3-config]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/boto3/latest/guide/configuration.html

### Configuration

As an alternative to the above environment variables you can specify the configuration directly in code, e.g

```python
sandbox = SandboxEnvironmentSpec(
    "ec2",
    Ec2SandboxEnvironmentConfig.from_settings(
        region="eu-west-2",
        vpc_id="vpc-123456",
        security_group_id="sg-56781234",
        s3_bucket="ec2sandboxstack-databucket123-456",
        instance_profile="Ec2SandboxStack-SandboxInstanceProfile123-456",
        ami_id="ami-123456",
        subnet_id="subnet-654321",
        instance_type="t3a.small",
        extra_tags=(("foo", "bar"),),
    ),
)
```

See [schema.py](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ec2_sandbox/blob/main/src/ec2sandbox/schema.py) for details.

## Compatibility with existing Inspect evals

This sandbox provider is not [Dockerfile-compatible](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/sandboxing.html#environment-binding).
Hence, you will have to rebuild your evaluation envionment on top of an AWS virtual machine AMI.

It is not a drop-in replacement; passing `--sandbox ec2` is unlikely to work for an existing eval.

## Sample evaluation

You can look at an existing [sample eval](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ec2_sandbox/blob/main/src/ec2sandbox/examples/where_am_i.py) for how to get started.

A more complex eval is [Sandbox Escape Bench](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/sandbox_escape_bench), where this EC2 sandbox is used as an outer sandbox and the agent is tasked with escaping an inner sandbox, generally Docker or Kubernetes.

## Sandboxing limitations

A sandbox is not a magic bullet for AI agent security. For more background, read AISI's [Inspect Sandboxing Toolkit](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/aisi-sandboxing).

For the EC2 sandbox specifically, beware that the IAM role used by the sandbox EC2 instance (which is required by this provider for communication) can also be used by the agent.


## Tech Debt / Missing features

- Move long-running AWS commands to a separate thread to avoid blocking Inspect's TUI
- better logging/tracing
- Dockerfile-compatibility
