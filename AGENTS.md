# Repo guidance for coding agents

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) too — dev setup, architecture, test invocation
and the reasoning behind the rules below are there.

## Before you open a PR

1. Does your change assert something about runtime behaviour — what EC2, SSM or S3
   actually does? Run it against real AWS and paste the output. Reading upstream source
   is not evidence, and neither is a test that patches boto3, however green.
2. Show it failing without your change and passing with it. If you can't, say so
   explicitly in the PR description.
3. If you can't run against real AWS, don't open the PR. Open an issue with your
   reasoning and stop.
4. Report what you actually ran, verbatim, including which tests were skipped. Never
   describe a run you didn't perform.
5. Note the tooling you used. If you ran review passes over your own change, say which
   model and what they found.

## Changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`)

New work goes under the `## Unreleased` heading. Each entry is
read by a **user of this library** — someone running `inspect eval` against the EC2
sandbox, or implementing a custom `Ec2InstanceProvider`. Write for them, not for a
reviewer of the diff.

Rules:

- **Describe what the user experiences, not how it's implemented.** The mechanism
  (SSM poll loops, boto3 client wiring, tenacity retry schedules, tracker internals)
  belongs in the PR, not the changelog. The user only cares about the observable change.
- **Cut the non-actionable.** If you're explaining *why* an obvious change is good, or
  *how* it works internally, cut it.
- **Keep what's actionable**: new config names, breaking-change migration steps,
  version requirements, the symptom a bug fix removes, public API names (exception
  types callers catch).
- **Don't churn existing entries.** When editing, make changes that are necessary
  (accuracy, completeness) and minimal. Don't swap synonyms or reorder for taste.

Examples (all from real entries in the sibling `inspect_k8s_sandbox` repo):

```
# Internal mechanism — the user can't act on "raw API JSON":
- Parse pod reads from the raw API JSON instead of the kubernetes client's model
  deserialization, which serialized under high concurrency and caused TimeoutErrors...
# The user-facing effect:
- Fix `TimeoutError`s in high-concurrency evals (many concurrent clusters).
```

[#211](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_k8s_sandbox/pull/211)

```
# Trailing justification of a self-explanatory change:
- Include the cause's type and message in `K8sError`'s string, so callers reading
  only str(error) can tell a transient infra error from a real failure.
# Just the change:
- Include the cause's type and message in `K8sError`'s string.
```

[#199](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_k8s_sandbox/pull/199)

```
# Leads with implementation:
- Propagate the caller's context into the pod-operation worker thread so Inspect
  sandbox config overrides are honoured.
# Leads with the effect:
- Honour Inspect sandbox config overrides (e.g. exec output size limits) that were
  previously ignored on Kubernetes.
```

[#201](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_k8s_sandbox/pull/201)

Detail is warranted when it's actionable. A breaking change earns its length because
the user must reconfigure:

```
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `allowDomains` egress is now restricted to ports 80/443, with
  the request identity enforced (TLS SNI on 443, HTTP `Host` on 80) rather than just
  the resolved IP. Wildcard entries require Cilium >= 1.18. New `allowDomainsPorts`
  opens other ports to those domains (IP-pinned; see `values.yaml`).
```

[#208](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_k8s_sandbox/pull/208)

A new config option keeps the "when would I use this" clause that distinguishes it from
existing options:

```
- Add a per-service `x-inspect_k8s_sandbox.resources` compose extension (alias `x-k8s`)
  for Kubernetes resource `requests`/`limits` (e.g. `ephemeral-storage`) that the
  `mem_limit`/`cpus`/`deploy.resources` shortcuts cannot express.
```

[#207](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_k8s_sandbox/pull/207)
